# üß¨ NGS Analysis Pipeline
*Work in Progress*

## üöÄ Overview

This repository contains a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data analysis pipeline. The environment leverages Python with bioinformatics libraries running on Linux to enable reproducible and efficient genomic data workflows. 

The current configuration is for variant calling following a sequencing run for a variety of genetic panels. 

The core workflow occurs with Snakemake while a Jupyter Notebook houses data analytics and visualizations.

## üîÑ Workflow

| Step Number | Step Name              | Description                                                                                   | Tools                                                                                       |
|:-----------:|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1           | Data Preparation       | Upload or mount raw sequencing data (FASTQ files) into the project directory.                 | Linux command-line utilities (`rsync`, `scp`), VirtualBox shared folders, SRA-tools (NCBI)  |
| 2           | Quality Control        | Perform quality control analyses to assess sequencing data quality.                           | [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), [MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/)             |
| 3           | Alignment & Processing | Map reads to the reference genome and process alignments, including marking duplicates and base quality score recalibration (BQSR). Collect QC metrics before and after these steps. | BWA, Bowtie2, SAMtools, [GATK](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us)                      |
| 4           | Variant Calling & Annotation | Detect genetic variants and annotate their functional effects.                                 | GATK HaplotypeCaller, SnpEff, ANNOVAR                                                       |
| 5           | Visualization & Reporting | Create plots, summaries, and reports to facilitate data interpretation.                        | Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter notebooks                                                     |
| 6           | Iterative Analysis     | Refine analysis parameters, rerun workflows, and document findings for reproducibility.       | Jupyter notebooks, version control (Git)                                                   |
